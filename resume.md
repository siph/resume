### Passionate software developer and open source contributor.

As a self-taught, high-performing solo developer, I have successfully navigated
a diverse range of projects across multiple disciplines, including web
development (front-end, back-end), systems integration, CLI applications,
scripting and more. With a strong focus on problem-solving, I excel at tackling
complex challenges head-on, leveraging my exceptional debugging skills to
identify and resolve intricate issues.

As a solo practitioner, I have developed a unique ability to distill problems
down to their core components, approach them with creative solutions, and
deliver high-quality results under tight deadlines. With no external assistance
or handoffs required, I have honed my skills in self-directed learning,
adaptability, and innovation - essential qualities that enable me to thrive in
fast-paced and dynamic environments.

Throughout my solo endeavors, I have consistently demonstrated a relentless
drive for excellence, precision, and attention to detail. By wearing multiple
hats across various technologies and domains, I have developed a broad and
versatile skill set that enables me to tackle a wide range of projects with
confidence and expertise.

I am also a passionate open source contributor and put a great value in the
collaborative and open processes involved and currently serve as a member of
the NixOS Organization.

I don't do leetcode.

## Projects

### **[*Resume-md*](http://www.github.com/siph/resume-md)**

Resume-md is a resume building, management, and hosting application.

With resume-md, you build your resume with markdown and the application will
build stylized PDF and HTML copies of the resume. Resume-md also will
automatically deploy the HTML file as a static website using GitHub Pages. This
allows technically minded people to use tools that they are already familiar
with (markdown, git) to achieve a professional-looking, fully web-hosted resume
with minimal effort. This resume that you're reading was built with resume-md.

### **[*posta*](http://www.github.com/siph/posta)**

[`Posta`](https://github.com/siph/posta) is a social blogging backend built
with SurrealDB. The project consists of a SurrealDB schema and uses Nix and
Nushell to setup and run tests to assert correct functionality.  

Some of the features that `Posta` offers:  

* User signup/signin
* Publish/edit posts
* Leave comments
* Favorite posts
* Subscribe to authors/tags
* Blocking/muting
